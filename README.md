# Cross-Account Data Retrieval Tester for Amazon Q index

## Overview

[Amazon Q index for ISVs](https://aws.amazon.com/q/software-provider/) is a capability that enables ISVs to access customers' enterprise data through Amazon Q Index to enhance their SaaS solutions with generative AI experiences. The service enables ISVs to utilize customers' Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) data in a novel approach compared to traditional connector-based data source integration. The service includes key features such as multi-tenancy isolation within the Amazon Q Index and direct API access through [Search Relevant Content API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qbusiness-ug/isv-calling-api-idc.html) for headless Amazon Q Business implementation. These capabilities support authenticated user experiences and enable ISVs to enrich their own generative AI applications and enhance end-user experiences.

How does an ISV’s access to customers’ Amazon Q index data work? The process involves three simple steps: 

1.	The ISV registers with AWS a data accessor.
2.	The customer adds that ISV as a data accessor to enable access to their index.
3.	The ISV can then query the customer’s index through cross-account Search Relevant Content API requests. 


Provided sample solution demonstrates cross-account data retrieval functionality for Amazon Q index using AWS IAM Identity Center (IDC) authentication setup on Amazon Q Business. The application implements a step-by-step process for user authentication, token generation, obatain temporary credential and data retrieval through Search Content Retrieval API.

#### Lambda function 
- coming soon

#### [MCP Server (AuthCode)](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp/tree/main/src/amazon-qindex-mcp-server)
- The AWS Labs amazon-qindex MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to facilitate integration with Amazon Q Business's SearchRelevantContent API. While the server provides essential tools and functions for authentication and search capabilities using Amazon Q index, it currently serves for Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) who are AWS registered data accessors. The server enables cross-account search capabilities, allowing ISVs who are data accessors to search through enterprise customers' Q index and access relevant content across their data sources using specific authentication and authorization flows.
